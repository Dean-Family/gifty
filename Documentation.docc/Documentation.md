### **Gifty**

#### **1. Introduction**
**Gifty** is a gift management application designed to simplify and enhance the experience of giving and receiving gifts. Built exclusively for iOS, with plans to extend to iPad and macOS, the application aims to provide seamless data synchronization using SwiftData. Users can start tracking a gift idea on their phone and fill in the details later on their laptop, ensuring a consistent and organized gifting process.

#### **2. Purpose**
The primary purpose of Gifty is to help users keep track of gift ideas, purchases, and events in an intuitive and organized manner. It aims to make the gifting process more enjoyable and less stressful by providing a central place to manage all aspects of gift-giving.

#### **3. Current State**
- **Platform**: Functional for iPhone, with basic UI and initial iPad support.
- **Data Synchronization**: Uses SwiftData to ensure data consistency between devices, moving away from CoreData.
- **UI**: Basic UI is implemented, with a focus on improving and polishing it for a more consistent user experience.
- **iPad Compatibility**: The app builds and runs on iPad, though not yet fully optimized.

#### **4. Features**
- **Data Sync**: Seamless synchronization across devices using SwiftData, aiming for real-time updates.
- **Swift Only**: Entirely written in Swift, utilizing SwiftUI for a modern and responsive interface.
- **One Codebase**: Unified codebase to maintain compatibility across iPhone, iPad, and future macOS support.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed to be simple and intuitive, ensuring ease of use.
- **Gift Management**:
  - Add gifts with details like descriptions, prices, and recipients.
  - View and sort gifts by various criteria.
  - Edit and delete gifts easily.

#### **5. Technology Stack**
- **Programming Language**: Swift
- **Framework**: SwiftUI
- **Database**: SwiftData (migrated from CoreData)
- **Cloud Service**: Previously CloudKit; now utilizing SwiftData for synchronization

#### **6. Goals**
- **Short-Term**:
  - Finalize a polished Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with consistent UI and complete features.
- **Mid-Term**:
  - Internationalize the app to support multiple languages for a wider audience.
  - Refactor code to improve modularity and maintainability.
  - Add comprehensive tests and documentation.
- **Long-Term**:
  - Incorporate professional artwork and design elements.
  - Prepare for App Store launch with a focus on quality and user experience.
  - Maintain and improve the app post-launch based on user feedback.

#### **7. Architecture Overview**
- Utilizes a SwiftUI-based architecture with SwiftData for state management and synchronization.
- Data flows through the app using a single source of truth, with views binding directly to data models.
- The architecture supports future extension to additional platforms (iPad and macOS).

#### **8. Code Structure and Organization**
- Current structure follows a "one view file per view" approach to maintain locality of thought.
- Each view file encapsulates the entire context for a screen, making it easy to copy-paste and modify.
- Plans to refactor the code for modularity, potentially organizing into distinct modules or directories for models, views, and utilities.

#### **9. Design Patterns and Principles**
- Focus on clean and maintainable code, with an end goal of making the app feel like a product created by Apple.
- Emphasis on user experience, ensuring that the interface is intuitive and polished.

#### **10. Testing and Quality Assurance**
- Current status: Some tests written.
- Tests cover UI elements and data handling. 

#### **11. Internationalization Plan**
- Plans to support multiple languages to make the app accessible to a wider audience.
- Key areas identified for localization include UI text, error messages, and date formats.
- Will utilize Swift's localization tools to handle multi-language support effectively.

#### **12. Roadmap and Future Enhancements**
- **MVP Completion**:
  - Finalize UI consistency and complete missing features.
  - Implement missing detail views and fix any broken previews.
- **Post-MVP**:
  - Internationalization and modular refactoring.
  - Add comprehensive tests and improve documentation.
  - Incorporate professional artwork and design elements.
- **Post-Launch**:
  - Monitor user feedback and perform maintenance.
  - Implement new features and improvements based on user needs.

#### **13. Challenges and Considerations**
- Addressing technical challenges such as broken previews and missing previews in detail views.
- Ensuring the app is modular and maintainable, despite the current "one view file per view" approach.
- Balancing the goal of creating an app with Apple-like polish while maintaining a streamlined development process.
